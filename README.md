## 🎧 My Music & 🎬 Movie Taste

I’m a huge movie enthusiast — I love diving into stories that inspire, challenge, and entertain.  
I’m also a fan of high-fidelity audio and immersive soundscapes.  
I mostly listen to indie, cinematic rock, pop, blues: anything that tells a story.  
Check out my personal playlists:

[![Spotify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spotify-🎵-1DB954?style=for-the-badge&logo=spotify&logoColor=white)](https://open.spotify.com/user/francescoverrengia62442)


## How It All Started
I first got into computers because I was determined to play games with my best friend, no matter what.  
To save money, I built my own PC from scratch.  
I had no idea that moment would change my life forever.  

I’m deeply grateful to the creators who taught me everything I needed to know:
[**Blink46**](https://www.youtube.com/@Blink46yt), [**Prodijeek**](https://www.youtube.com/@Prodigeek), [**MoreThanTech**](https://www.youtube.com/@MoreThanTech), [**SaddyTech**](https://www.youtube.com/@SaddyTech).

I’m leaving my favorite games below. Who knows? Maybe one of these games will start someone else’s journey too.


## 🎮 My Favorite Games
Gaming fuels my creativity and inspires my projects!

- **Dark Souls 3** 🗡️🔥
- **Elden Ring** 🗡✨
- **Assassin's Creed Black Flag** 🏴‍☠️⛵
