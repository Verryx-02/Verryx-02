## 🎧 My Music & 🎬 Movie Taste

I’m a huge movie enthusiast — I love diving into stories that inspire, challenge, and entertain.  
I’m also a fan of high-fidelity audio and immersive soundscapes.  
I mostly listen to indie, cinematic rock, pop, blues: anything that tells a story.  
Check out my personal playlists:

## 🎮 My Favorite Games and the Marks They Left on Me
Gaming fuels my creativity and inspires my projects!
Here are some of the games I love to dive into:

- **Dark Souls 3** 🗡️🔥
- **Elden Ring** 🗡✨
- **Assassin's Creed Black Flag** 🏴‍☠️⛵
- **Watch Dogs** 📱💻
- **Overwatch** ❤️✨
- **Just Cause 3** 💥🪂
- **Final Fantasy XV** 👑⚔️
- **Metro Last Light Redux** ☢️🌆

<br>

🗡️🔥 **Soulslike** taught me resilience: failure isn’t the end, it’s just part of the process.  
Patience, reflection, and adaptability are the only ways to progress — in games, and in life.

🏴‍☠️⛵ **Assassin’s Creed Black Flag** ignited a fire for freedom and the unknown — the call to leave safe harbors behind and chart unmarked waters.  
It taught me that true growth lies beyond the comfort zone, where adaptability becomes survival and every decision carries weight.  
In the world of cybersecurity, that same mindset is essential: stay sharp, expect the unexpected, and never stop exploring.

📱💻 **Watch Dogs** opened my eyes to the vulnerabilities in modern infrastructure, fueling my interest in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

❤️✨ **Overwatch** highlighted the value of teamwork: success depends on trust, coordination, and playing your role to support others — lessons I carry into every collaborative project.

💥🪂 **Just Cause 3** taught me the power of creative chaos — thinking outside the box, turning the environment into a tool, and embracing bold strategies.  
It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most effective path is the one you craft yourself, with precision — and sometimes, with improvisation.
